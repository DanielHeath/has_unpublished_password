# HasUnpublishedPassword

## What is it?

This is a gem which performs offline checks against the [HIBP](https://haveibeenpwned.com/) master list.

It can be used to ensure that your users are not using credentials which have previously been leaked.

The checks are performed using a pre-built bloom filter.

## Status

I just threw this together and haven't used it in production (yet - planning to next week).

The released version of this gem includes ~30mb of bloom filter containing the top 11,200,000 most-leaked passwords according to HIBP.

Checking set membership is *fast*, and the false positive rate is about 0.001%.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'has_unpublished_password'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install has_unpublished_password

## Usage

### Validation

`validates :password, never_leaked_to_hibp: true`

## Development

### Building the filter

First, download the master list from HIBP (I used the 'ordered by frequency' list) and decompress it.

Then, run `bundle exec data/prepare-and-validate.rb <path-to-master-list-file>`.

This takes quite awhile; it'll print how many lines it's completed periodically.
